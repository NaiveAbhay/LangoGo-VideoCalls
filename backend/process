first we do install the dependencies
setup the sever env file then formalised it into constrollers and rotes
then we connect the mongodb cloud and changes the network access permisson to allow everyone in mongodb
then we setup stream keys in env file
then we created user model and pre-hook inside it to save hashed password in database
then we worked on user signup, jwt token generation , cookie setup
then we worked on login and logout while login we learn to use methods of modules ex match password in this case
after that we have created user for stream as well because stream will also perform authentication in its end that user is authentic or not ( of our database on stream)
after that we have created onboarding route for which first we created ProtectRoute middleware that checks if user is loggedin or not using cookies 
updated stream user as well
then we started working on user routes like get recommendedusers and getFriends 
then we created model Friend Req 
then we created more function user routes like sentFriendReq acceptFriendReq  getFriendReq and more
then we created chat route just to create stream token
